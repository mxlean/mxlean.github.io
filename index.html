                I&apos;m the best designer to untangle your worst software&nbsp;knots.
            </p>
            <p>
                I specialize in platform design and accessible design systems, cutting complexity with object-based UX patterns. I help product leaders grow the long-term vision that makes short-term work feel&nbsp;obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I&apos;m also just an efficient interface designer and excellent&nbsp;coworker.

                <h2>Hiring Availability</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm looking for new work! Please reach out to <a href="mailto:jamie@mclean.xyz">jamie@mclean.xyz</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part-time contracting is ideal, but I&apos;m open to full-time or salary depending on the&nbsp;role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I collaborate best with online tools and do not work in-office for health reasons (non-negotiable). I can work with hybrid and distributed teams across global time zones and otherwise pick up design projects&nbsp;mid-flight.

                <h2>Professional Background</h2>
                <p>
                    I self-taught front-end development during my graphic design BFA and have woven software design with other work since&nbsp;2012. (<a href="resume.pdf">PDF Resume</a>)
                </p>
                <h3>Product & Platform Design</h3>
                <p>
                    I&apos;ve shipped features and built design process with over a dozen high-performing product teams, solving 10&times; scaling problems for content production and support services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I drove platform and data integration strategy behind the scenes at <a href="https://www.2u.com">2U</a> and <a href="https://www.getbento.com">BentoBox</a>, whose CTO non-ironically referred to me as an <q>architect&nbsp;genius</q>.
                </p>
                <h3>Design Systems & Ops</h3>
                <p>
                    My branding and front-end skills also made managing these a fluid part of my work:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>migrations from Photoshop (I am old) to Sketch to Figma</li>
                    <li>overhauls and automations as better tooling developed</li>
                    <li>consolidation of teammates&apos; work into scalable patterns</li>
                    <li>full-system redesign and variable definition</li>
                    <li>final code implementation and developer training</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I improved components as resources allowed while increasing UI consistency, accessibility, and velocity across&nbsp;teams.

                <h2>Work Mindset</h2>
                <p>
                    Professionally, I resonate with <a href="https://www.ooux.com/people/sophiavprater">Sophia Prater</a>&apos;s work and take a real-world approach to software design. Personally, I keep active in my communities, skilled in practical trades, and grounded in social context. Craft quality and thoughtfulness are very important to me. I assert my convictions but always seek out common interests and points of&nbsp;action.
