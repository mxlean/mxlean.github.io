                I&apos;m the best designer to untangle your worst software&nbsp;knots.
            </p>
            <p>
                I specialize in platform UX, design strategy, and accessible design systems. I simplify complex data with object-oriented design patterns. I help product leaders develop the long-term vision that makes short-term features and updates feel obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I&apos;m also just an excellent day-to-day coworker.

                <h2>Hiring Availability</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm currently looking for new work! Please reach out to <a href="mailto:jamie@mclean.xyz">jamie@mclean.xyz</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part-time contracting is ideal, but I&apos;m open to full-time or salary for the right organization and role. Let&apos;s talk about your range of needs and work from there.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I collaborate most effectively with online tools and do not work in-office for medical reasons. I can work very smoothly with hybrid or distributed teams across any time&nbsp;zone.

                <h2>Professional Background</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="resume.pdf">PDF Resume</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I taught myself front-end development during my 2010&ndash;14 BFA in graphic design and have woven corporate software design work into other opportunities over the last&nbsp;decade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&apos;ve shipped features with over a dozen product teams and driven long-term platform UX and data integrations at <a href="https://www.2u.com">2U</a> and <a href="https://www.getbento.com">BentoBox</a>, whose CTO once referred to me as a <q>detail architect genius</q> during annual employee awards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My branding background also made me the practical keeper of component libraries, managing tooling migrations from Photoshop (I&apos;m old &#128579;) to Sketch to Figma and major design system overhauls. I improved visual design as often-sparse resources allowed and focused on increasing consistency, accessibility, and velocity across&nbsp;teams.

                <h2>Personal Mindset</h2>
                <p>
                    I&apos;m active in my communities, skilled in practical trades, and grounded in the social and material context of my work. Craft quality and thoughtfulness are very important to me. I assert my convictions but always seek out common interests and points of&nbsp;action.
