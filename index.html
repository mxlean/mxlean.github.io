                I&apos;m the best designer to untangle your worst software&nbsp;knots.
            </p>
            <p>
                I specialize in platform design and accessible design systems, cutting complexity with object-based UX patterns. I help product leaders grow the long-term vision that makes short-term work feel&nbsp;obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
                I&apos;m also just an excellent day-to-day coworker.

                <h2>Hiring Availability</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm looking for new work! Please reach out to <a href="mailto:jamie@mclean.xyz">jamie@mclean.xyz</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Part-time contracting is ideal, but I&apos;m open to full-time or salary depending on the&nbsp;role.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I collaborate most effectively with online tools and do not work in-office for medical reasons. I can work smoothly with hybrid and distributed teams across global time&nbsp;zones.

                <h2>Professional Background</h2>
                <p>
                    <a href="resume.pdf">PDF Resume</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I self-taught front-end development during my graphic design BFA and have woven software design work with other opportunities since 2012.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I&apos;ve shipped features and built design process with over a dozen high-performing product teams, solving 10&times; scaling problems for content production and support services. I drove strategy around platform UX and data integration at <a href="https://www.2u.com">2U</a> and <a href="https://www.getbento.com">BentoBox</a>, whose CTO once publicly referred to me as their <q>detail architect&nbsp;genius</q>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My branding and coding skills also made design systems and ops a fluid part of my work: I managed migrations from Photoshop (I am old) to Sketch to Figma, overhauls and automations as better tooling developed, consolidation of teammates&apos; work into scalable patterns, and final code implementation. I improved components as resources allowed while increasing UI consistency, accessibility, and velocity across&nbsp;teams.

                <h2>Personal Mindset</h2>
                <p>
                    I resonate strongly with <a href="https://www.ooux.com/what-is-ooux">Sophia Prater</a>&apos;s work in my real-world approach to software design. I am active in my communities, skilled in practical trades, and grounded in social and material contexts. Craft quality and thoughtfulness are very important to me. I assert my convictions but always seek out common interests and points of&nbsp;action.
