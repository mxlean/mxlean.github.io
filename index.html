      Hi! I&rsquo;m Jamie.

      I&rsquo;m a designer with broad technical skills, education domain knowledge, and experience helping software teams build simple, accessible, and scalable content&nbsp;tools.

    <h3>
      Brief Background
    </h3>
    <p>
      I was the first hire on the design team at <a href="https://2u.com">2U</a> and spent over four years building UI systems and designing the online education platform now used for 100+ master&rsquo;s degree and certificate programs at <a href="https://2u.com/partners/">35+&nbsp;universities</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, I&rsquo;ve been helping start and operate an <a href="https://wonderville.nyc">indie arcade</a>, doing event and portrait photography, designing indie games, and organizing for accessible, safe, and free public&nbsp;transit.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h3>
      What I&rsquo;m Looking For
    </h3>
    <p>
      I&rsquo;m seeking a design position that lets me contribute to high-level strategy while still doing ground-level production work, ideally at an organization with a social mission. I&rsquo;d be open to a range of positions but would probably fit best as a senior product designer in most tech&nbsp;organizations.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h3>
      My Work Style
    </h3>
    <p>
      I aim to help a team clarify its vision. I think methodically. I push towards quality in my work but avoid perfectionism in evolving systems. I lay out future possibilities to avoid pitfalls. I regularly ask myself, &ldquo;Is the the best way to do this?&rdquo; I cultivate the relationships, habits, vocabulary, and vision to grow success over the long&nbsp;run.

    <h3>
      Course Management Platform
    </h3>
    <p>
      I worked for two years on a product team to help transform an MVP for one client into enterprise-scale course planning and production software. We worked with content production to restructure and automate a maze of unique processes, tools, and data models into a single global&nbsp;workflow.
    </p>
    <img src="images/curriculum/screenshots/planner.png"/>
    <img src="images/curriculum/screenshots/builder.png"/>
    <p>
      Extreme development constraints required resourceful planning, and the best solutions often limited UI development. I focused instead on designing information architecture and workflows to cleanly scale versioned curriculum data across 2U products and third-party learning&nbsp;tools.

      <h3>
        Design System
      </h3>
      <p>
        I helped develop and iterate a design system in both code and design tools over four years. This involved maintaining a shared symbol library and working with the design team to incorporate new components as needs&nbsp;arose.
      </p>

      <img src="images/design-system/tooltip.gif"/>
      <img src="images/design-system/Toggle.gif"/>
      <p>
        The system required brand customization while maintaining strict accessibility standards and layout consistency, so we automated changes throughout the system based on a handful of variables the marketing team could control&nbsp;directly.

    <h3>
      Lecture Player
    </h3>
    <p>
      I led an emergency two-week project to ship an embedded cross-platform player for multimedia lectures. Since development had to start immediately, I prioritized known back-end tasks for developers to give me and another designer a few days to collect existing research, build a plan, and design component specs on a rolling&nbsp;basis.

    <p>
      We were able to ship on time while also building toward a research-informed vision for accessible multimedia content, where all visuals and annotations in the video would be exposed with descriptions alongside the&nbsp;transcript.
